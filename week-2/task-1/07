What is a Callback Function in JavaScript?
Ans~~ A callback function is a function passed as an argument to another function and executed later.

Callbacks are essential in JavaScript because they allow asynchronous operations, such as:

Handling user interactions
Fetching data from APIs
File reading
Timers (setTimeout, setInterval)
  
         AND

 Why Are Callbacks Important?
✅ Handle Asynchronous Tasks (API requests, file reading, event handling).
✅ Avoid Blocking Execution (JavaScript is single-threaded).
✅ Used in Higher-Order Functions (Array methods, event listeners).
