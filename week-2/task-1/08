JavaScript has five types of loops, which are used to execute a block of code repeatedly based on a condition. 
Hereâ€™s a breakdown:

~~1. for Loop
Used when the number of iterations is known.

~~2. while Loop
Used when the number of iterations is unknown but depends on a condition.

~~3. do...while Loop
Similar to while, but executes at least once before checking the condition.

~~4. for...in Loop
Iterates over the properties (keys) of an object.

~~5. for...of Loop
Iterates over iterable objects like arrays, strings, maps, etc.
